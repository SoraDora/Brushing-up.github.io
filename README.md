# Brushing-up

This is just an experimental web I made to brush up my front-end coding skills since I have been coding in python for a year for my final year project..
and 6 months of using analytical tools (with a bit of computer vision's task on the side) in my previous internship.

I tried to incorporate trendy UI I've seen this year (I tried..). 

The content of the web might be a bit silly and informal so please bear with it.
